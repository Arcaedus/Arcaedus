Hello👋 My name is Nathan Earl Maglasang. I am from Cebu Technological University-Main Campus taking BS in Computer Engineering 😄

I have a very huge interest in game development 🎮 and a little bit in Web Design 🕸️! I am currently studying Python🐍, Java, and reviewing C, C++, and C#. I hope to become a successful game developer in the future!

I decided to join here to improve my knowledge 🧠, skills ⚔️, as well as meeting new people in the same field of interests. 😊

Skills I learned (rusty in some areas 😔):
Mobile and Web Development | Music/Sound Producer in games (from past unfinished projects) | Embedded Systems (beginner level) | Game designing | IoT Integrations
